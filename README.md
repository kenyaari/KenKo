# KenKo: A Health and Fitness App
KenKo (meaning "health" in Japanese) is an Android app that allows a user to track their macros, reach a daily goal, and receive workout suggestions.

The app consists of a nutrition tab and an exercise tab.

The nutrition tab contains a field where users can enter their consumed diet, which would then call a nutrition API to obtain information on its macros.

The exercise tab initiates a conversation with a ChatGPT API to suggest workout routines.
